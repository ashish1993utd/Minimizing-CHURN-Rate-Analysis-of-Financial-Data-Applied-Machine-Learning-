# Minimizing CHURN Rate Through  Analysis of Financial Habits   
   
   
Subscription Products are often the main source of revenue in the companies that have them. No matter what industry the company is in, they want to minimize the amount of people that unsubscribe also known as Churn.
    
    We need to identify the patterns that led to churn
    
    Target of our model is everyone who has subcribed to our subscription product. The product we are working with can provide the customer with a lot of value even if they are yet to realize.
    
    We are working on a finance tracking product provided by a company, help with cc, loans , financial education. 
    
    We want to increase profits and keep the customers engaged, be it by reminding them of the benefits they are getting of by builiding new products/features that may appeal to users. 
    
    Because this is a finance tracking product, we have access to customer finances as well as how they leverage the product to handle those finances. Beacuse financial data can often be unreliable and delayed, we will stick to product related data in this project plus this type of data is more indicative of what type of features customers want because it is product related.
